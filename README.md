# UniversalCEFR Experiments

This repository is being updated at the moment. 

The preprocessing scripts for `EFCAMDAT`, `APA-LHA`, `BEA Shared Task 2019 Write and Improve`, and `DEPlain` are found in `preprocessing` folder for transforming these raw datasets to UniversalCEFR format. Feel free to download and edit the scripts (and edit as you need to). We could not upload a public version of the derivations of these datasets as stipulated in their Terms of Use.
